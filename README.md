##  Project Overview

As part of our **Embedded Systems course** under the guidance of **Dr. Emad Badry**, we built a **Digital Visitor Counter** using the AT89C51 microcontroller. The system detects people entering or exiting a space and displays the total on an LCD. If the count exceeds a safety threshold, an alarm triggers automatically.

##  Features

- Real-time visitor detection via **IR sensors**
- Dynamic display on a **16x2 LCD**
- Safety alerts using **LED & buzzer**
- Works even during outages using a **rechargeable battery**
- Full simulation in **Proteus**

##  Components Used

- AT89C51 (8051) Microcontroller  
- IR Sensors  
- LCD Display (16x2)  
- Buzzer & LED  
- Push Buttons  
- Resistors, Capacitors  
- Power Supply Components

---

##  Simulation

We used **Proteus** to simulate and test the circuit.

### How to Run:

1. Extract the `.zip` file  
2. Open the `.pdsprj` file in **Proteus 8 or later**  
3. Simulate and observe:
   - IR-triggered counting
   - LCD updates
   - Alert system in action

---

##  Code Functions

We wrote embedded C code to:

- Detect visitor entry/exit using sensors  
- Update count on the LCD  
- Trigger buzzer when limit is reached  
- Handle edge cases and resets
